/// The STICKY-HEADER mixin works with (sticky-header.plugin.js) to hide
/// a siteâ€™s header.primary element as you scroll down page. The element
/// reappears when the user scrolls up the page. This is
/// responsive as the "top" value is dynamically set in the
/// js based on the height of the header. Top padding is also added
/// to the body dynamically via js so that the header doesn't overlap any
/// content.
